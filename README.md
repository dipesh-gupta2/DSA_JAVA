# DSA / Java Repository

This repository contains various Java programs and data structures & algorithms (DSA) practice problems. The code is organized into different categories and includes implementations of search algorithms, sorting algorithms, array manipulations, string operations, and more.

## Directory Structure

- **Arrays**:  
  Contains programs related to array manipulation and practice.

- **LINEAR_SEARCH**:  
  Implementation of the linear search algorithm, which is a basic search algorithm used to find an element in an array or list.

- **SORTINGALGORITHMS**:  
  Contains implementations of common sorting algorithms.  
  - Sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, and others are implemented for practice and learning.

- **Strings**:  
  Programs focusing on string manipulation, operations, and problem-solving using string data structures.

- **binarysearch**:  
  This folder contains programs related to binary search, a faster search algorithm for sorted arrays.

- **classcode**:  
  Java practice exercises and programs from classwork, covering basic to intermediate concepts in Java programming.

- **Main.java / Main.class**:  
  The main entry point for some Java programs. `Main.java` contains the code, while `Main.class` is the compiled bytecode of the `Main.java` file.

- **2D array questions**:  
  Programs solving questions related to two-dimensional arrays, which are often used in matrix operations and grid-based problems.

## Key Programs

- **LINEAR_SEARCH**:  
  Simple implementation of the linear search algorithm for searching elements in an unsorted array.

- **SORTINGALGORITHMS**:  
  A set of programs covering various sorting techniques. Sorting algorithms are essential for understanding time complexity and optimization in DSA.

- **Strings**:  
  This section contains solutions and utility programs for string manipulation and pattern matching.

- **binarysearch**:  
  Implementation of binary search, which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm to efficiently find an element in a sorted array.

## Java Practice and Projects

- **Java Practice**:  
  Exercises and programs for strengthening Java programming skills, covering topics like OOP, arrays, and string handling.

- **JAVA PROJECT**:  
  Contains larger Java projects or assignments that were worked on during the course of Java practice.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
